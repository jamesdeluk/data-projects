# [WIP] Companies House analysis

Analysing Companies House data for insights such as average director age and average director tenure.

Work in progress - the code is still messy.

Interesting findings so far:
1. 14,239,717 companies in this data
2. Some people are over 150 years old (apparently)
3. The average director age for an active company seems to be 50
